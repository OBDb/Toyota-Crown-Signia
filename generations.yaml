    description: "The Toyota Crown Signia represents an expansion of the reimagined Crown lineup, offering a more practical wagon-like crossover variant alongside the elevated Crown sedan introduced in 2022. Based on the same TNGA-K platform as the standard Crown and sharing its front-end styling, the Crown Signia differentiates itself with a distinctive fastback/liftgate design replacing the sedan's traditional trunk, creating a silhouette reminiscent of luxury European sport wagons but with a slightly elevated ride height. Measuring approximately 190.6 inches in length—about 4 inches shorter than the Crown sedan—the Signia features the same 112.2-inch wheelbase but with a more practical rear configuration offering up to 25.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. Powered exclusively by Toyota's fourth-generation hybrid system combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with front and rear electric motors for a combined 243 horsepower and standard electronic all-wheel drive, the Crown Signia prioritizes efficiency alongside premium positioning. The interior mirrors the Crown sedan's upscale approach with standard leather seating, a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, 12.3-inch central touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, heated and ventilated front seats, and a panoramic moonroof. Advanced technology includes Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 with pre-collision system, dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and proactive driving assist. Available in XLE and Limited trim levels, the Crown Signia targets buyers seeking the premium character of the Crown with enhanced versatility, competing in the niche space between luxury SUVs and traditional wagons. As part of Toyota's strategy to reinvent the Crown nameplate for modern preferences while maintaining its premium position in the lineup, the Signia represents the North American version of what is sold as the Crown Estate in some other markets."
